fastermath
========

A library of math functions targeted at 32-bit and 64-bit x86 Linux systems.

The purpose of this library is to provide faster drop in replacements for
selected functions of the standard math library 'libm'. These functions
are written so they can be more optimized by compilers and all special
case tests for increased consistency and accuracy have been removed.
They are based on the corresponding implementations from the Cephes math
library by Stephen L. Moshier. The code has been simplified perusing
internal compiler facilities wherever possible and assuming little
endian IEEE-754 single and double precision math.

Installation
============

This package is x86  and Linux specific and  makes heavy use of advanced
features of the GNU toolchain  and thus requires a somewhat recent GNU C
compiler, GNU binutils and GNU Make to be installed. Specifically:
 - GNU make
 - GNU C compiler
 - GNU binutils

To compile simply type "make". This should produce two
libraries libfastermath.so and libfastermath.a. Those
two libraries and the header fastermath.h should be copied
to a suitable location, e.g. /usr/local/lib or /usr/local/lib64
and /usr/local/include, respectively.
