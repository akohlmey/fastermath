fastermath
========

A library of optimized math functions targeted at 32-bit and 64-bit
x86 Linux systems.

The purpose of  this  library is  to provide  drop in  replacements  for
selected functions of the standard  math library 'libm'. These functions
are optimized  versions of the   corresponding implementations from  the
Cephes math library by Stephen L.  Moshier.  In most cases, the original
code has  been simplified,  rewritten to  assume  little endian IEEE-754
single and double precision math,  and reorganized to allow compilers to
use SSE/AVX vector instructions.


Installation
============

This package is x86  and Linux specific and  makes heavy use of advanced
features of the GNU toolchain  and thus requires a somewhat recent GNU C
compiler, GNU binutils and GNU Make to be installed. Specifically:
 - GNU make (tested with version 3.82)
 - GNU C compiler (tested with version 4.5.1)
 - GNU binutils (tested with version 2.20.51.0.7

To compile simply type "make". This should produce two
libraries libfastermath.so and libfastermath.a. Those
two libraries and the header fastermath.h should be copied
to a suitable location, e.g. /usr/local/lib or /usr/local/lib64
and /usr/local/include, respectively.
